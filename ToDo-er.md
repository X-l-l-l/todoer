 # ToDo-er

## Introduction

ToDo-er is a simple and easy to use task management app for single users, but also for small teams that want to keep their work structured and organised using a set of lists of items/tasks.
The user can create his own lists of tasks but he can also join a team, in which the leader can asign tasks to his teamates, set deadlines, add descriptions, etc.
The built in calendar will help the user better visualise their task deadlines and schedules.

Any user can create a team and invite friends or peers into their team. The difference between a teamate and a team leader is that the leader can assign different tasks to any of the other teamates.

## Objectives
- To create a simple, but powerful app to help the user organise his tasks
- To store the users tasks and organise them
- To boost productivity, not only for individual users, but also for teams
- To create an app that takes away the need to remeber when to do something so the user only has to focus at the task at hand
- To develop a user friendly system that has a nearly flat learning curve

## Benefits
This app can benefit individuals, as well as teams, helping them track their daily tasks, their schedules, their teamates work, etc. It can boost productivity for anybody, removing the problem of remembering **when** and **what** has to be done, so the user can focus on **how** the task has to be done.
